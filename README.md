# Connections Lab Project 2: Collaborative Bulletin Board 
Fatima Aljunaibi (toomie) & Fatema Alhameli

## Concept 
Our basic concept is to make a bulletin board website where multiple people can add drawings or doodles to the bulletin board. People can make private rooms and choose a theme for everyone to draw. Users will then draw something that fits the theme and get to choose their favorite drawing at the end.
